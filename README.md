# Alakazam

## A ridiculously fast EXPERIMENTAL PTC proxy checker

Alakazam is a simple, fast, and efficient PTC proxy checker. It is designed to be as fast as possible, and can check thousands of proxies in a matter of seconds.
In my case, I was able to check 12,000 proxies in 9 seconds.

### Installation

To install Alakazam, simply clone the repository and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
You will need a txt file with your proxies in IP:PORT format.
You can then run the script with `python3 test_proxies.py`.

See? Super easy :)
